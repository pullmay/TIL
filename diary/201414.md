## TIL

I solved [this](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc140/tasks/abc140_d) problem. It costs about an hour.

I understood Langlens compression and defined a function in `Algorithm/algorithms.py`. 
Also, there were accompanying problems in AtCoder, so I solved those problems.

- [ABC 136 D](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc136/tasks/abc136_d)
- [ABC 019 B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc019/tasks/abc019_2) <- Exactly the same!
