### ABC 163
Unfortunately, the contest was unrated this time. I submitted problem A in C langage, so I have to be careful next time. The problem C was implemented with the collections module in mind, but I could have written it simpler. The problem D had no idea how to solve it at all, so I referred to the PDF of the explanation. I can understand if you say so, but I can't do it myself.

最初、C言語で提出してしまい一敗。その後、提出結果が```IE```と表示されて焦った。
