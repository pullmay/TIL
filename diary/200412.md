## TIL

I waked up at 11 am since I drunk too much yesterday with friends on online. 

I participated in AtCoder Beginner Contest 162. I was not able to solve D problem. Also, the problem C was not easy.

To get improve my skill of competitive programming, I have to make a plan of studying. 

What I should understand are as follows:

- (run length encoding)[http://www.nct9.ne.jp/m_hiroi/light/pyalgo29.html]
- (binomial coefficient)[https://www.planeta.tokyo/entry/5195/]
- DFS / BFS
- Dijkstra /  Warshall–Floyd / Bellman–Ford
- Union Find
- DP
