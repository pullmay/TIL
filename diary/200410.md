# TIL
Today, I experienced TOEIC Speaking Test by using GIB Spealing Test which is a iOS App. It was so difficult that I was not able to answer well. In the near future, I may work with people who are not familiar with Japanese, so I would like to train English speaking skill.

# What did I do?

* I created [this](https://pullmay.github.io/Factorization/) Web site. It was a first experience for me to use javascript language, so it costs lots of time. Thunkfully, My. Hayakawa helped me with cheking my code.
* I solved [D-Lucky PIN](https://atcoder.jp/contests/sumitrust2019/tasks/sumitb2019_d). My code is [here](https://atcoder.jp/contests/sumitrust2019/submissions/11727574).

# What did I learn?

* Python command `zfill` is usefull
