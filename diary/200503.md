## TIL

Today I studied segment trees and BIS and tried to implement them in `python`. I'm not good at implementing using classes, so I also studied object orientation.

### ABC166

* A: easy
* B: I took a little bit long time...
* C: It was difficult for me. I thought it took `O(N^2)`, but I could get `AC`
* D: equation
* E: I couldn't solve. It is not so much difficult for E problem. 

### solved

I solved some problems in [Educational DP Contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp).
