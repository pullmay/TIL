## TIL

Last night I went to bed early due to fatigue. I was going to get up early in the morning, but I ended up getting up at 8:00.

I created repository for Rasen book. All of the questions in this book are on the AOJ website.

I learned the basis of how to use git command and HitHub. If you don't want to delete a file on GitHub, you can delete it locally and push it, instead of deleting it on GitHub.
