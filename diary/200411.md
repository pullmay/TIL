## TIL

### 200411

I solved some problems on AtCoder. What I solved are as follows:

- [C - One-stroke-Path](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc054/submissions/11747246)
- [C - Average Length](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc145/submissions/11743428)
- [B - Achieve the Goal](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc151/submissions/11741278)

I also attempted to solve [this problem](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_c), but it was too difficult for me to solve. The main reason why I could not solve is that I do not understand how to implement bit exhaustive search. It is remained issue.

### What I learned today

- the usage of `itertools` (see [here](https://github.com/pullmay/Algorithms/blob/master/itertools.py))
- the basic idea of bit exhaustive search (I read this [article](https://qiita.com/gogotealove/items/11f9e83218926211083a))

### To my future self

Do not seek for the best. First of all, you should finish that.
