### diary

I've been assigned to a place. Unfortunately, the placement was not where I had originally imagined it would be. In addition, the place where I worked was not what I had originally envisioned. I can't help complaining, but it's a bit depressing. I feel like I'm underestimating my abilities.

### solved

- [Chocolate Bar](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc074/tasks/arc074_a)：数学的な問題かと思ったけど、全通り試す感じで解くらしい。[こちら](https://misteer.hatenablog.com/entry/ARC074-C)を参考にした。
