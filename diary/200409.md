# TIL
Today I Learned are as follows:

- Python's functions such as `any()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, etc.
- github.io (I made my own [cv](https://pullmay.github.io/cv/))
- the basec usage of Git 

# What did I did?
I solved [ABC034-C](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc034/tasks/abc034_c) 

# What did I think?
It was tough work to make my cv site.

# What do I want to know?

- The way of displaying the result of integer factorization on github.io more beautifully
